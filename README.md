## TFM Project


This is my final master's project. The purpose of this project is to make a comparison between the classic prediction models for time series (ARIMA, NAIVE and ETS) with those properly built for count data (INAR and Hidden Markov) and thus determine their effectiveness.

The datasets used are: number of strikes in Spain (source: INE) and number of days per month with rainfall (source: AEMET)
